/**
 * Owns the two-finger scrollback gesture on the pad SSH client.
 *
 * Responsibilities (full scope in
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-gesture-scrollback-design.md):
 *   1. Multi-touch detection — pass through single-finger events,
 *      consume two-finger events and translate the dy to row deltas
 *      written to emulator.mTopRow.
 *   2. New-output counting — `pendingOutputCount` accumulates while
 *      the user is scrolled back; the banner reads it to render the
 *      "▼ N 行新输出" badge.
 *   3. State emission — `StateFlow<ScrollbackState>` is the single
 *      source of truth for the banner. Writes from IO thread go
 *      through `view.post { ... }` to land on the UI thread before
 *      any emission (Termux's emulator is single-threaded; same
 *      contract as TerminalView.reportPtyResize).
 *
 * No `release()` lifecycle — the controller is owned by the wrapper
 * and GC'd with it. Matches [SelectionController].
